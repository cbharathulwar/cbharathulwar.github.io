## About Me

Hi! I’m Chinmay, an undergraduate freshman at the University of Maryland. I plan on double majoring in Physics and Math. I love learning about theoretical physics, specifically high energy and condensed matter physics. Additionally, I am interested in the use of AI and Machine Learning in theoretical physics. I’m also a diehard Knicks and Dolphins fan and love watching basketball, football, and Formula 1.

## Research Interests

- **Theoretical and High-Energy Physics:** improving reconstruction methods for collider experiments (e.g., LHC); exploring models in particle physics and field theory

- **Condensed Matter Physics:** interest in quantum systems, emergent phenomena, and many-body physics

- **Computation in Physics:** using tools like graph networks and attention models to study physical systems and improve simulation accuracy

## Current Work

Currently, I am working on using GNNs and Attention mechanisms to improve LHC reconstruction accuracy and efficiency. I am also looking for research groups where I can actively contribute and learn!

## Other

If you’re interested in the intersection of sports, science, and math, check out my blog!  

Feel free to reach out — I’m always happy to talk about physics, computation, or research opportunities.
