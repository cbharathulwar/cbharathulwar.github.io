## About Me

Hi! I’m Chinmay, a incoming freshman at the University of Maryland. I plan on double majoring in Physics and Math. I love learning about theoretical physics, specifically high energy and condensed matter physics. Additionally, I am interested in the use of AI and Machine Learning in theoretical physics. I’m also a diehard Knicks and Dolphins fan and love watching basketball, football, and Formula 1.

## Research Interests

-	**Theoretical and High-Energy Physics:** improving reconstruction methods for collider experiments (e.g., LHC); exploring models in particle physics and field theory
- **Condensed Matter Physics:** interest in quantum systems, emergent phenomena, and many-body physics
- **Computation in Physics:(( using tools like graph networks and attention models to study physical systems and improve simulation accuracy

## Current Work

Currently, I am working on using GNN’s and Attention mechanisms to improve LHC reconstruction accuracy and efficiency. I am also in the process of editing my book that I wrote that seeks to explain theoretical physics at a more accessible level.
